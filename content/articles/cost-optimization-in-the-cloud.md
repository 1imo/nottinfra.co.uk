Cloud bills can spiral without discipline. A few practices keep costs predictable and aligned with value.

## Right-Sizing

Review instance types and storage. Many workloads are over-provisioned. Use metrics to match resources to actual usage.

## Reserved Capacity

For stable workloads, reserved instances or savings plans can cut spend by 30–50% compared to on-demand.

## Tagging and Visibility

Tag all resources by team, project, and environment. Use cost allocation reports to see who spends what and why.
