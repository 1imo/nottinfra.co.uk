IT services that serve external clients require extra care: availability, security, and clear communication.

## SLAs and Transparency

Define realistic SLAs and communicate them clearly. When things go wrong, proactive updates build trust.

## Security First

Client data demands strong controls. Use least privilege, encryption, and regular audits as baseline practices.

## Documentation

Provide clear docs for clients: how to access services, how to get support, and what to expect in normal operation.
