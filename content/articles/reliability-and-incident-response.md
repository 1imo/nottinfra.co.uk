Systems fail; how you respond defines your reliability culture. Preparation and clear processes reduce stress and downtime.

## Runbooks

Maintain runbooks for common scenarios: deployments, restarts, failovers. Keep them simple and updated.

## Incident Roles

Define incident commander, scribe, and communicator. Rotate roles so everyone learns the flow.

## Post-Incident Reviews

Conduct blameless post-mortems. Focus on what went wrong, what worked, and what to change – not on who to blame.
