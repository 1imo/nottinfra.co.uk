DevOps bridges development and operations, fostering collaboration and automation. Teams that embrace DevOps typically ship faster and recover quicker.

## Core Principles

1. **Automation** – Automate repetitive tasks to reduce human error.
2. **Collaboration** – Dev and ops work together from day one.
3. **Continuous feedback** – Monitor, learn, and improve.

## Next Steps

Start with a simple CI pipeline, then add deployment automation. Focus on one improvement at a time.
